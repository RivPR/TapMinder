# TapMinder
 * Group- WebApp using Java, SpringMVC, MySQL, HTML/CSS

##What is it/ Back story

With the dozens(over 60!) of Microbreweries in the Denver area alone, many of those Microbreweries have a rotating selection of beers, with a lot of them seasonal beers that are only available for a limited time.  There are some Apps that track beers and your ratings, but most of them rely on the barcode (or UPC) of the beer, but in the Microbrewery game beers are almost never available in other forms other than from the tap. Thanks to TapMinder you can have a reminder (Get it?) of that amazing beer you had that fuzzy night with that cute individual you can hardly remember as well. Who knows? Maybe you will see them at that same bar again! 

###Purpose

TapMinder2 allows it's users to remember which beers they liked, and where they had them.  The WebApp also enables users to view ratings of various beers, on a scale from 1 to 5.  There is functionality of searching for breweries by different parameters, such as name, zip code, neighborhood, and city or no parameters to search for all available breweries, it provides the user with an easier way to find beers with no effort.


There is also functionality to search for breweries by different parameters, such as zip code, neighborhood, or city.
